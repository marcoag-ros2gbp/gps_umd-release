  * Fixing orientation in UTM odometry message
    Before the fix, the orientation in the odometry message was set to x = 1, y = 0, z = 0, w = 0. This corresponds to Euler angles of roll = pi, pitch = 0, yaw = 0. I believe the intent was for the orientation to be the identity, which is x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, w = 1.
